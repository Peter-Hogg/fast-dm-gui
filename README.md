The GUI was developed by Stefan Radev and Veronika Lerche as an extension to the new version of fast-dm (Voss, Voss, & Lerche, 2015):

It provides a flexible interface to the earlier command-line tool written in C including a visualization module and prallelised parameter estimation over participants.

A tutorial for the GUI is coming soon...
